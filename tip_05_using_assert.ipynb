The `assert` statement is a powerful tool that allows you to check if a condition is true and raise an exception if it's false. In this blog post, we'll explore how to use `assert` to raise an exception if a condition isn't met and see some practical examples."

This requires that you verify certain conditions, such as the validity of user inputs or the correctness of computations. While you can use if statements to check for conditions and raise an exception if they're not met, this can become verbose and difficult to read, especially when dealing with complex conditions. In addition, it can be easy to overlook these checks, leading to subtle bugs that may be difficult to catch.\n",
